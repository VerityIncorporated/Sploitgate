# Sploitgate

Sploitgate was a cheat I was at some point passionate about, hence why it looks so sexy.
The code is terrible and its management was not good at all, I removed all authentication
and encryption files, they're not needed. I also removed the runtime GUID Changer because its not mine.
The reason this is now open source is due to its popularity, the Splitgate devs manually banned the GUID of the file
causing everyone to be banned, this was while it was free. Since then its been a back and forward fight for undetectedness.
I am working on 2 other projects atm so this won't be getting any attention from me, as long as you make a whole new project
and skid the code only a little bit you can make your own private build that should stay undetected. Enjoy.
